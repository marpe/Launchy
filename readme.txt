This is a simple application launcher written in C#/WPF.

A list of the running applications is saved every 5 minutes so they can be launched quickly using this tool.

Use CTRL+SPACE to focus, write the first few letters of an application and it will show up if it's added in the list.

Running applications are also added in the list and will come into view and focus when selected.

F1 opens up the list of entries for viewing and editing.
